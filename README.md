# ðŸŒŽ Hello World!

This project has been created using **webpack-cli**, so you should run

```
npm run build
```

To bundle your application, also you can just check the file package.json to see available scripts

This is my first little project, just a quick excercise using arrays and its methods to further solidify my knowledge, with a dark background of course because i love dark mode.

Also remember to use

```
npm install
```
